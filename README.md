Natural Language Processing Frontend Web App
This repository implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) web app using Aylien API. This is how Wikipedia defines NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

NLP typically is resource intensive. However, Aylien API makes it simple for us. The app will use the API to determine various attributes of a given piece of text.

Usage Instructions
The app is constituted of a couple of parts: the frontend app and a background server app. The former handles interactions with the user, while the latter handles API interaction. The entire code is linted using eslint:recommended configuration during webpack compile.

Here is how to get started in production mode:

Clone the repository to your machine, cd to app directory
Install required packages: npm install
Place a .env file containing two values: APP_ID and API_KEY. These refer to your personal Aylien 'Application ID' and 'API Key' respectively. The file is not supplied with the repo for privacy purposes.
[PRODUCTION MODE] Start the production app: npm run start or simply npm start. Visit localhost:8081 in your web browser.
[DEVELOPMENT MODE] Start the development app: npm run start-dev. This will automatically start a web browser session.
An example of .env file:

API_ID=************\*\*************
API_KEY=************\*\*************
The App will NOT run if any of the above steps are not followed. I have tried to produce meaningful errors when there are issues like this.
